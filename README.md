- Most popular genres and tags on Steam
- Top publishers and developers by number of games
- Games distribution by required age rating
- Most expensive games on Steam
- Supported languages across games
- Games with achievements

## Conclusions

After cleaning and analyzing the Steam dataset, several interesting patterns were found.

Windows dominates the market as the primary gaming platform, while Mac and Linux represent a significantly smaller share of supported games. In terms of content, most games on Steam have no age restriction, and only a small portion require players to be 13, 17 or 18 years old.

Regarding publishers and developers, the data revealed that a few studios concentrate a large number of releases, with adult content developers surprisingly leading the charts. Action and Indie genres proved to be the most popular across the platform, reflecting current trends in game development.

Finally, a notable portion of games include an achievement system, indicating that developers actively use them as a tool to improve player engagement and retention.
